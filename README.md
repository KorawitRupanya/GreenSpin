Fashion that lasts, sustainability that matters.
Be Fashionably Sustainable.

Spinnova, a Finnish sustainable material company, produces textile fibers from wood. This process is eco-friendly, saving water, energy, and generating zero waste. The fibers are versatile and can be used in the fashion and textile industries. Currently they plan to break through the noise in the crowded space of fashion. Being a company committed to sustainability, they plan to grow organically rather than by viral storm.

Many consumers lack knowledge and understanding of the environmental and social impact of their clothing choices. Our solution, SpinGreen, addresses this knowledge gap by creating a community around the brand and partnering with sustainability campaigns to educate consumers and catalyse their roadmap towards sustainable fashion.

Partnering with like-minded organisations and individuals can help to leverage collective reach and influence to raise awareness and shift consumer attitudes towards more sustainable choices. By providing clear information about the sustainability of their products, Spinnova can help consumers to make more informed choices and encourage other fashion companies to follow suit.

Allowing customers to thrift Spinnova apparel from each other promotes the circular economy by extending the lifespan of products and reducing textile waste. This can make sustainable fashion more accessible and appealing to a wider audience, potentially increasing demand for Spinnova products and promoting sustainable fashion on a larger scale.

Collaborating with consumers on the same level as influencers can create a sense of community and belonging among passionate sustainable fashion consumers. It also increases brand loyalty and advocacy, as consumers feel like they have a stake in the brand and its products. This collaboration can help Spinnova better understand consumer needs and preferences, and as a result identify potential partners and marketing strategies.

Our recommendation features partners with a range of sustainable fashion brands to suggest new pieces that complement consumers' existing wardrobes, helping them build a more sustainable and stylish wardrobe. Spinnova's personalized recommendations and user-friendly interface boost consumer confidence in discovering new sustainable fashion options.

The Spinnova Sustainability map feature enables users to donate old clothes to designated bins and learn about local sustainability events. It also helps users locate nearby retail stores of Spinnova's partner brands, providing value to both Spinnova and its collaborators.

As an organisation keen on spreading awareness, the Spinnova app also has a sustainability wheel with encouraging statistics as to how the members are contributing towards the different dimensions of sustainability. SpinGreen instils the flair of Spinnova's allegiance to sustainability. In this way, Spinnova can help consumers to develop a sustainable mindset and become THE SUSTAINABLE BRAND in the world of fashion.
